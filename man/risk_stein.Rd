\title{Stein Risk function from Pang et al. (2009).}
\usage{
  risk_stein(N, K, var_feature, num_alphas = 101, t = -1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{N}{the sample size.}

  \item{the}{number of classes.}

  \item{var_feature}{a vector of the sample variances for
  each dimension.}
}
\value{
  list with alpha: the alpha that minimizes the average
  risk under a Stein loss function.  If the minimum is not
  unique, we randomly select an alpha from the minimizers.
  risk: the minimum average risk attained.
}
\description{
  This function finds the value for alpha \in [0,1] that
  empirically minimizes the average risk under a Stein loss
  function, which is given on page 1023 of Pang et al.
  (2009).
