During the Alon sim, I noticed that var_shrink with SDLDA was constant for all 30 genes,
even before diagonalization. Need to double-check that this is correctly implemented.

Add pi_k to the classifier to DLDA
Add option to set prior probabilities DLDA.
	'prior = 1' indicates equal probabilities.

Add pi_k to the classifier to DQDA
Add option to set prior probabilities DQDA.
	'prior = 1' indicates equal probabilities.

Add pi_k to the classifier to SDLDA
Add option to set prior probabilities SDLDA.
	'prior = 1' indicates equal probabilities.

Add pi_k to the classifier to SDQDA
Add option to set prior probabilities SDQDA.
	'prior = 1' indicates equal probabilities.
